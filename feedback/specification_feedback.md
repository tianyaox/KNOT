Specification Feedback
============
Good job in writing the specification document and models. 
I can see that team has good overall idea of the project and models and specification document reflects that. I could not see UI mock ups related to use of API to get friends (from gmail, fb, twitter etc), uploading/downloading contacts in json/csv format. I would recommend to improve/add actions instead of just including the pages and related functionality. We expected action names in views.py and what each action is supposed to do.
Coming to the tasks in Sprint 1, I would recommend one of your team member to lead or take responsibility. Otherwise, good breakup of tasks and functionalities.
Overall, nice job. Looking forward to next stage of your project.
