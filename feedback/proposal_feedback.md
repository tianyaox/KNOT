Proposal Feedback
============

 > "Overall your project idea is good, and will provide a good opportunity for you to sucessfully demonstrate the fundamental web application engineering ideas of this course.

 > I am very concerned, though, that the mobile client aspect of your project introduces a substantial risk to the success of your project.  As you have presented your project's key ideas, the success of your web application -- the part of your project that will demonstrate your understanding of the fundamental ideas of the course -- depends on you successfully implementing your mobile application.  In its current form the web application portion of your project is overly simplistic for a three-person project, and there is little of that project that you could complete (in an interesting way) before your mobile application is functioning.

 > I strongly recommend that your plan your project in such a way to mitigate this risk.  The success of your web application -- specifically, the success of a substantial-enough web application to justify a three-person team -- should not depend on the success of your mobile client implementation.  

 > Ideally, you might eliminate the mobile client application entirely and include a mobile interface as an extra feature to be completed only when the rest of your project is complete.  If your web application interactions are well designed, a mobile client could be implemented simply as an extra interface to your existing application, and you could demonstrate all of your web application's supported interactions inside a web browser without relying on the mobile client.  You might even consider integrating your contact list information with external sources of data, e.g. by using external APIs such as the Facebook API.

 > Looking forward to the next phases of your project,

 > Your team's project sounds very interesting that involves both web app and mobile application. I guess the key to your application is that you need to synchronize server/client/mobile. Try to come up with an efficient design to send notifications and maintain current status up-to-date. I first want you to create working web app that allows basic contacts sharing and send notifications to friends when there is a change. Once this feature is working, I guess you could start building mobile app. I'm not sure how hard it is to use BUMP API, but the project seems reasonable if you are familiar with developing iPhone applications.

 > If you do not have prior experience with mobile application programming, then I would recommend eliminating the mobile application aspect entirely. The main purpose of this project is to assess how well you can apply the concepts of web development that you learned in this class towards developing a medium to large-scale web application. Even if you have experience with mobile app programming, I would suggest that you develop a web app with all of the listed features, including those of the mobile app, and then, if you have time, migrate some of those features to the mobile app. That being said, I think the project sounds great, especially the information security aspect. I am looking forward to seeing it in action.
